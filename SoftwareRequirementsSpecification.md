## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes all specifications for the application "CouchPotato". It includes an overview about this project and its vision, detailed information about the planned features and boundary conditions of the development process.

### 1.2 Scope
This software specification applies to the whole "CouchPotato" application. The app allows a group of users to select a movie or series to watch together. Displaying of the actual videos is not part of the application scope.

### 1.5 Overview
The following chapters are about our vision and perspective, the software requirements, the demands we have, licensing and the technical realization of this project.
    
## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision

We want to build a application that connects a group of friends and especially their movie preferences. A final Web-Application will provide many different movies, divided by selected genres. Every member of the party will individually vote the suggested movies as good or as bad. At the end, when the group meets up, CouchPotato will suggest a matching movie according to the individual votes of every member.

The idea is to create an application, which helps a group of people to select an movie to watch, for example at a movie night, in advance.
